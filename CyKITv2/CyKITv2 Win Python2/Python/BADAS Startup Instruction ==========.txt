-Run python 2 (Only 2.7.14 64bit tested) command prompt
-Make sure airsim is not installed from pip, 'pip uninstall airsim' to be sure
-'pip install msgpack-rpc-python' is needed for airsim

-For python 64 bit: 'pip install pycrypto' is needed for CyKITv2, where building pycrypto needed VCForPython27 Compile tools in my case.
-For python 32 bit: 'Crypto32bitPy' (original lib of CyKITv2) could be used instead of 'pycrypto', could try pycrypto too, or if you want 'Crypto32bitPy' then change Lines 39 and 40 in eeg.py to use 'Crypto32bitPy' instead of 'Crypto'

-Make sure Emotiv is on and connected.
-Run airsim BADAS level

-cd to path "\Python"
-Run 'python CyKITv2.py', html will open auto, press connect.
-Open Recording tab > Press Record, it should be saving eeg and airsim data now, stop to save.
